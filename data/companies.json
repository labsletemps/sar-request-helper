If they do choose to name categories, they must justify why this is fair, and be specific, naming \"the type of recipient (i.e. by reference to the activities it carries out), the industry, sector and sub-sector and the location of the recipients. ( Article 29 Working Party, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019 WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018 ) Please note that in the case of any transferred data processed on the basis of consent, there is no option to just name categories of recipients without invalidating that legal basis (Article 29 Working Party, \u2018Guidelines on Consent under Regulation 2016/679\u2019 (WP259 rev.01, 10 April 2018) 13).\n\n- If any data was not collected, observed or inferred from me directly, please provide precise information about **the source of that data**, including the name and contact email of the data controller(s) in question (\"from which source the personal data originate\", Article 14(2)(f)/15(1)(g)).\n\n- Please confirm where my personal data is physically stored (including backups) and at the very least **whether it has exited the EU at any stage (if so, please also detail the legal grounds and safeguards for such data transfers)**.\n\nInformation on purposes and legal basis\n---------------------------------------\n\n- All **processing purposes and the lawful basis for those purposes by category of personal data**. This list must be broken down by purpose, lawful basis aligned to purposes, and categories of data concerned aligned to purposes and lawful bases. Separate lists where these three factors do not correspond are not acceptable (Article 29 Working Party, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019 (WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018), page 35.\n). A table may be the best way to display this information.\n\n- The **specified legitimate interest** where legitimate interest is relied upon (Article 14(2)(b)).\n\nInformation on automated decision-making \n----------------------------------------\n- Please confirm whether or not you make any automated decisions (within the meaning of Article 22, GDPR). If the answer is yes, please provide meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for me. (Article 15(1)(h))\n\nInformation on storage\n----------------------\n- Please confirm for how long each category of personal data is stored, or the criteria used to make this decision, in accordance with the storage limitation principle and Article 15(1)(d).\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not normally deal with these requests, please pass this email to your Data Protection Officer. If you need advice on dealing with this request, any European Data Protection Authority should be able to provide you with assistance. \n\nIn accordance with the law, I look forward to hearing from you within one month of receipt.\n\nRegards,\n\n<< FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME >>", "recipient": "dpo@blizzard.com"}, {"key": "Q1938", "data": "mailto:datenschutz@sbb.ch?subject=Demande%20d%27acc%C3%A8s%20CFF&body=Demande%20d%27acc%C3%A8s%20aux%20donn%C3%A9es%20personnelles%20%28art.%208%20LPD%29%0A%0A%0ACher%20CFF%2C%0A%0AMadame%2C%20Monsieur%2C%0A%0APar%20la%20pr%C3%A9sente%2C%20je%20souhaite%20exercer%20mon%20droit%20d%E2%80%99acc%C3%A8s%20conform%C3%A9ment%20%C3%A0%20l%E2%80%99article%208%20de%20la%20loi%20f%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale%20sur%20la%20protection%20des%20donn%C3%A9es%20%28LPD%29.%0A%0AJe%20vous%20prie%20de%20bien%20vouloir%20me%20communiquer%20par%20%C3%A9crit%20et%2Fou%20sous%20forme%20%C3%A9lectronique%2C%20dans%20un%20d%C3%A9lai%20de%2030%20jours%20%28art.%201%20al.%204%20OLPD%29%20et%20gratuitement%20%28art.%202%20OLPD%29%2C%20des%20renseignements%20d%C3%A9taill%C3%A9s%20sur%20chacun%20des%20points%20suivants%C2%A0%3A%0A%0Atoutes%20les%20donn%C3%A9es%20me%20concernant%20qui%20sont%20contenues%20dans%20votre%20%28vos%29%20fichier%28s%29%2C%20y%20compris%20les%20informations%20disponibles%20sur%20l%E2%80%99origine%20des%20donn%C3%A9es%C2%A0%3B%20le%20support%20%28disque%20dur%2C%20documents%20papiers%2C%20etc.%29%20n%E2%80%99a%20aucune%20importance%C2%A0%3B%0Ale%20but%2C%20les%20finalit%C3%A9s%20et%20la%20base%20juridique%20du%20traitement%20des%20donn%C3%A9es%C2%A0%3B%0Ala%20dur%C3%A9e%20de%20conservation%20des%20donn%C3%A9es%20et%20donn%C3%A9es%20de%20connexion%C2%A0%3B%0Al%E2%80%99existence%20et%20les%20motifs%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9ventuelles%20communications%20transfronti%C3%A8res%20de%20donn%C3%A9es%C2%A0%3B%0Ales%20cat%C3%A9gories%20de%20donn%C3%A9es%20personnelles%20trait%C3%A9es%C2%A0%3B%0Ales%20cat%C3%A9gories%20de%20participants%20au%28x%29%20fichier%28s%29%C2%A0%3B%0Ales%20cat%C3%A9gories%20de%20destinataires%20des%20donn%C3%A9es.%0A%0ACette%20requ%C3%AAte%20couvre%20toutes%20mes%20donn%C3%A9es%20personnelles%20%0A%0A%0AJe%20vous%20saurais%20%C3%A9galement%20gr%C3%A9%20de%20me%20confirmer%20express%C3%A9ment%20que%20les%20renseignements%20que%20vous%20me%20ferez%20parvenir%20sont%20complets%20et%20corrects.%20Si%20vous%20ne%20pouvez%20pas%20me%20donner%20ces%20renseignements%2C%20ou%20seulement%20de%20mani%C3%A8re%20partielle%2C%20je%20vous%20prie%2C%20en%20vertu%20de%20l%27art.%209%20LPD%2C%20de%20bien%20vouloir%20motiver%20votre%20d%C3%A9cision.%20Je%20me%20permets%20de%20vous%20rendre%20attentif%20%C3%A0%20la%20teneur%20de%20l%E2%80%99article%2034%20LPD%20relatif%20aux%20cons%C3%A9quences%20p%C3%A9nales%20d%E2%80%99un%20refus%20injustifi%C3%A9%20ou%20d%E2%80%99une%20communication%20partielle.%0A%0A%0A%0A%0AEn%20vous%20remerciant%20de%20votre%20diligence%20et%20en%20vous%20souhaitant%20bonne%20r%C3%A9ception%20de%20la%20pr%C3%A9sente%2C%20je%20vous%20prie%20d%E2%80%99agr%C3%A9er%2C%20Madame%2C%20Monsieur%2C%20mes%20salutations%20distingu%C3%A9es.%0A%0A%3C%3CPRENOM%20NOM%3E%3E", "Recipient": "CFF", "Mailto": "mailto:datenschutz@sbb.ch", "Text-unquoted": "Demande d'acc\u00e8s aux donn\u00e9es personnelles (art. 8 LPD)\n\n\nCher CFF,\n\nMadame, Monsieur,\n\nPar la pr\u00e9sente, je souhaite exercer mon droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur la protection des donn\u00e9es (LPD).\n\nJe vous prie de bien vouloir me communiquer par \u00e9crit et/ou sous forme \u00e9lectronique, dans un d\u00e9lai de 30 jours (art. 1 al. 4 OLPD) et gratuitement (art. 2 OLPD), des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s sur chacun des points suivants\u00a0:\n\ntoutes les donn\u00e9es me concernant qui sont contenues dans votre (vos) fichier(s), y compris les informations disponibles sur l\u2019origine des donn\u00e9es\u00a0; le support (disque dur, documents papiers, etc.) n\u2019a aucune importance\u00a0;\nle but, les finalit\u00e9s et la base juridique du traitement des donn\u00e9es\u00a0;\nla dur\u00e9e de conservation des donn\u00e9es et donn\u00e9es de connexion\u00a0;\nl\u2019existence et les motifs d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles communications transfronti\u00e8res de donn\u00e9es\u00a0;\nles cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es personnelles trait\u00e9es\u00a0;\nles cat\u00e9gories de participants au(x) fichier(s)\u00a0;\nles cat\u00e9gories de destinataires des donn\u00e9es.\n\nCette requ\u00eate couvre toutes mes donn\u00e9es personnelles \n\n\nJe vous saurais \u00e9galement gr\u00e9 de me confirmer express\u00e9ment que les renseignements que vous me ferez parvenir sont complets et corrects.

including a subject access request, a portability request, and other specific provisions. **Please note that it is not legal to require data subjects to use an  in-house form**. (see for instance UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, \u2018Subject Access Code of Practice\u2019 (9 June 2017) p 13; Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, \u2018Guide to the GDPR: Right to access\u2019 (22 May 2019), stating that 'even if you have a form, you should note that a subject access request is valid if it is submitted by any means, so you will still need to comply with any requests you receive in a letter, a standard email or verbally [..] although you may invite individuals to use a form, you must make it clear that it is not compulsory')\n\nI would like to request a copy of all my personal data held and/or undergoing processing. This is both a subject access request and a portability request.\n\nCopies of my personal data\n==========================\nThis request covers all my personal data and in particular the following which your privacy documentation mentions:\n\n  - browsing history;\n  - advertising ID;\n  - marketing segment;\n  - app usage information;\n  - Facebook Custom Audiences;\n  - Facebook Beacon;\n  - Facebook Exchange;\n  - Facebook Like;\n  - Facebook Lookalike Audiences;\n  - user interaction data;\n  - profiling information;\n  - notification data;\n  - replacement IDs generated by Facebook;\n  - information and content I have provided;\n  - metadata about information and content I have provided;\n  - what I see through the features you provide;\n  - analyses you have performed on my information or content;\n  - data with special protections I have provided;\n  - information about my networks, connections, Pages, Hashtags and Groups;\n  - synced contact information;\n  - my usage information;\n  - transaction information;\n  - things others have done and information they have provided about me;\n  - device attributes;\n  - device operations;\n  - unique identifiers;\n  - device signals;\n  - data from device settings;\n  - network and connections information from devices;\n  - cookie data;\n  - Information from Facebook Business Tools, social plugins,  Facebook Login, Facebook APIs, SDKs, Facebook Pixel;\n  - information about activities off facebook;\n  - what information has been shared with partners about me.\n\nArticle 20\n----------\nFor data falling within the right to data portability (GDPR, art 20), which includes all data I have provided *and* which have been indirectly observed about me (Article 29 Working Party, *Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability (WP 242)*, 13 December 2016, 8) and where lawful bases for processing include consent or contract, I wish to have that data:\n\n-   **sent to me in commonly used, structured, machine-readable format**, such as a CSV file. A PDF is not a machine-readable format (Article 29 Working Party, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019 WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018).\n\n-   accompanied with an **intelligible description of all variables.**\n\nArticle 15\n----------\nFor all personal data not falling within portability, I would like to request, under the right to access (GDPR, art 15):\n\n-   **a copy sent to me in electronic format**. This includes any data derived about me, such as opinions, inferences, settings and preferences. (Note that opinions, inferences and the like are considered personal data. See Case C\u2011434/16 *Peter Nowak v Data Protection Commissioner* [2017] ECLI:EU:C:2017:994, 34.)  For data that is available to the controller in machine readable format, it must be provided to me in that form in accordance with the principle of fairness and provision of data protection by design.\n\nIf your organisation considers me a controller for whom you process\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nFurthermore, if your business considers me the controller of any personal data for which your business acts as processor, please provide me **with all the data you process on my behalf in machine readable format** in accordance with your obligation to respect my to determination of the means and purposes of processing.\n\n\nMetadata on processing\n======================\nThis request also includes the metadata I am entitled to under the GDPR.\n\nInformation on controllers, processors, source and transfers\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- The **identity of all joint controllers** of my personal data, as well as the essence of you contracts with them (Article 26).\n\n\n- Any **third parties to whom data has been disclosed**, named with contact details in accordance with Article 15(1)(c).

This list must be broken down by purpose, lawful basis aligned to purposes, and categories of data concerned aligned to purposes and lawful bases. Separate lists where these three factors do not correspond are not acceptable (Article 29 Working Party, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019 (WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018), page 35.\n).

( Article 29 Working Party, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019 WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018 ) Please note that in the case of any transferred data processed on the basis of consent, there is no option to just name categories of recipients without invalidating that legal basis (Article 29 Working Party, \u2018Guidelines on Consent under Regulation 2016/679\u2019 (WP259 rev.01, 10 April 2018) 13).\n\n- If any data was not collected, observed or inferred from me directly, please provide precise information about **the source of that data**, including the name and contact email of the data controller(s) in question (\"from which source the personal data originate\", Article 14(2)(f)/15(1)(g)).\n\n- Please confirm where my personal data is physically stored (including backups) and at the very least **whether it has exited the EU at any stage (if so, please also detail the legal grounds and safeguards for such data transfers)**.\n\nInformation on purposes and legal basis\n---------------------------------------\n\n- All **processing purposes and the lawful basis for those purposes by category of personal data**. This list must be broken down by purpose, lawful basis aligned to purposes, and categories of data concerned aligned to purposes and lawful bases. Separate lists where these three factors do not correspond are not acceptable (Article 29 Working Party, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019 (WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018), page 35.\n). A table may be the best way to display this information.\n\n- The **specified legitimate interest** where legitimate interest is relied upon (Article 14(2)(b)).\n\nInformation on automated decision-making \n----------------------------------------\n- Please confirm whether or not you make any automated decisions (within the meaning of Article 22, GDPR). If the answer is yes, please provide meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for me. (Article 15(1)(h))\n\nInformation on storage\n----------------------\n- Please confirm for how long each category of personal data is stored, or the criteria used to make this decision, in accordance with the storage limitation principle and Article 15(1)(d).\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not normally deal with these requests, please pass this email to your Data Protection Officer. If you need advice on dealing with this request, any European Data Protection Authority should be able to provide you with assistance. \n\nIn accordance with the law, I look forward to hearing from you within one month of receipt.\n\nRegards,\n\n<< FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME >>", "recipient": "dpo@twitter.com"}, {"key": "Q101", "data":
